Start with just a bit (half a tsp if you are using the chipotle stuff. Trust me, it’s hot).\n6. Get your wrap ready with sour cream and spinach or lettuce, add black bean salsa mixture, add salsa, guacamole.\n7. Enjoy!\n\n**NOTE**: you can also add left over rice to this mixture for extra “oomph”. It will fill you up and stretch the recipe a bit further (more days without cooking!)\n\n**Extra:** Add left over black bean salsa to nachos or on top of lettuce with extra salsa as a salad. You can wrap it in wraps and coat with enchilada sauce (the fiesta stuff in a small bag) and cover with cheese for enchiladas. If you do this, just pour some enchilada mixture in the pan to coat the bottom BEFORE adding the wraps to the dish. Pour remaining sauce on top, add cheese and bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes.
